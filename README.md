<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview
<img src="./screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot from the Country Quiz Demo"/>

The demo is currently available at [Vercel](https://country-quiz-celeste.vercel.app/).
This project is my first approach to the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework. It's done with CSS Modules, and it's also my first personal project that was made responsive.
It was a good experience to brush up my logical skills, and I'm very happy with the current result ‚ò∫Ô∏è
